        "\n",
        "The reason logistic regression has the word \"regression\" in its name is due to its **historical and statistical relationship to linear regression**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of why:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Modeling a Relationship:** Like linear regression, logistic regression aims to **model the relationship** between a set of predictor variables (independent variables) and an outcome variable (dependent variable). In linear regression, the outcome variable is continuous. In logistic regression, the outcome variable is **binary** (or sometimes ordinal or multinomial, but the core concept starts with binary).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Linear Combination of Predictors:** At its heart, logistic regression uses a **linear combination of the predictor variables** to estimate the outcome. This is the same fundamental structure as in linear regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    Linear Regression:  y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + ε\n",
        "    Logistic Regression (in the logit space): log(p / (1 - p)) = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ...\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "    Notice the right-hand side of both equations is a linear combination of the predictors and their coefficients (the β values).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Predicting a Value (Indirectly):** While linear regression directly predicts the value of the continuous outcome, logistic regression **indirectly** predicts the probability of the binary outcome belonging to a specific category (usually coded as 1). This probability is then used for classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Mathematical Foundation:** Many of the statistical concepts and techniques used in logistic regression, such as maximum likelihood estimation for finding the coefficients and hypothesis testing for their significance, have their roots in the broader field of regression analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Think of it this way:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic regression takes the familiar linear regression framework and applies a **transformation (the logit function)** to the outcome variable (the probability of success). This transformation allows us to model a binary outcome using a linear combination of predictors while ensuring the predicted probabilities stay within the valid range of 0 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary, the \"regression\" part of \"logistic regression\" comes from:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The use of a linear combination of predictor variables.\n",
        "* The goal of modeling the relationship between predictors and an outcome.\n",
        "* The shared statistical underpinnings with linear regression.\n",
        "\n",

        "   ```\n",

        "* `√x₂`\n",
        "* `log(x₃)`\n",
        "* `x₁ * x₂` (interaction terms, while sometimes included in regression models, make the overall model non-linear in the original predictors)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is this important in regression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The linearity of the combination simplifies the mathematical properties of the model and makes it easier to interpret the individual effects of the predictor variables (assuming no interaction terms).

        "Interaction terms **can contribute to multicollinearity** in a regression model (both linear and logistic). Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is Multicollinearity?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multicollinearity refers to a high degree of correlation between two or more predictor variables in a regression model. This can cause problems in estimating the individual effects of each predictor, leading to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How Interaction Terms Introduce Multicollinearity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Interaction terms are created by multiplying two or more existing predictor variables together (e.g., `x₁ * x₂`). This inherently creates a relationship between the interaction term and its constituent main effect terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Relationship with Main Effects:** The interaction term `x₁ * x₂` will naturally be correlated with both `x₁` and `x₂`.\n",
        "    * If `x₁` increases, `x₁ * x₂` will also tend to increase (assuming `x₂` is not always zero or negative).\n",
        "    * Similarly, if `x₂` increases, `x₁ * x₂` will also tend to increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Mathematical Dependency:** The interaction term is mathematically derived from the main effects, creating a direct dependency. If you know the values of `x₁` and `x₂`, you automatically know the value of `x₁ * x₂`. This strong linear relationship is the essence of multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you are modeling the effect of study time (`hours`) and prior knowledge (`knowledge_score`) on exam performance. You also include an interaction term `hours * knowledge_score`.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's likely that `hours` and `hours * knowledge_score` will be correlated. Students who study more might also have higher values for the interaction term.\n",
        "* Similarly, `knowledge_score` and `hours * knowledge_score` will likely be correlated. Students with higher prior knowledge will tend to have higher values for the interaction term.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Consequences of Multicollinearity with Interaction Terms:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The consequences are the same as with any other source of multicollinearity:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Unstable Coefficient Estimates:** The standard errors of the coefficients for the main effects and the interaction term will tend to be inflated. This makes it harder to determine if the individual effects are statistically significant (you might fail to reject the null hypothesis even if there is a true effect).\n",
        "* **Difficulty in Interpretation:** It becomes challenging to isolate the individual effects of the main variables because their impact is intertwined with the interaction effect. For example, it's harder to say what the \"pure\" effect of `hours` is when you also have an interaction with `knowledge_score`.\n",
        "* **Inflated Variance of Coefficients:** The variance of the estimated coefficients increases, making the estimates less precise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to Address Multicollinearity with Interaction Terms:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Centering Predictors:** One common technique is to center the main effect variables before creating the interaction term. Centering involves subtracting the mean of each variable from its values. This can often reduce the correlation between the main effects and their interaction term. For example, instead of using `hours` and `knowledge_score`, you would use `(hours - mean(hours))` and `(knowledge_score - mean(knowledge_score))` to create the interaction term.\n",
        "* **Careful Interpretation:** Be cautious when interpreting the individual coefficients of the main effects in the presence of significant interaction terms. The effect of one main variable depends on the level of the other interacting variable.\n",
        "* **Consider the Research Question:** Ensure that the interaction term is theoretically justified and crucial for your research question. If it's not essential, you might consider removing it.\n",
        "* **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** Calculate the VIF for all predictors, including the interaction term. High VIF values (typically above 5 or 10) indicate a potential multicollinearity problem.\n",
        "* **Combine or Remove Variables (with caution):** If multicollinearity is severe and the interaction term isn't critical, you might consider combining related variables or removing one of the highly correlated predictors. However, removing an interaction term can change the interpretation of the main effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In conclusion, interaction terms are a common source of multicollinearity because they are mathematically derived from and inherently related to their constituent main effect variables. It's important to be aware of this potential issue and take steps to mitigate its impact on your regression analysis.**"

However, what about an email message with a prediction score of 0.6? In order to map a logistic regression value to a binary category, you must define a classification threshold (also called the decision threshold). A value above that threshold indicates \"spam\"; a value below indicates \"not spam.\" It is tempting to assume that the classification threshold should always be 0.5, but thresholds are problem-dependent, and are therefore values that you must tune.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Fisher's Approach:** Primarily focused on obtaining a p-value to assess the evidence against a single null hypothesis. The emphasis was on the strength of evidence provided by the data.\n",
        "* **Neyman-Pearson Approach:** Introduced the framework of decision-making between two specific hypotheses (null and alternative) and emphasized the control of error rates in repeated experiments. Key concepts included:\n",
        "    * **Type I Error (False Positive - α):** Rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
        "    * **Type II Error (False Negative - β):** Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.\n",
        "    * **Power (1 - β):** The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.\n",
        "    * **Setting a Significance Level (α):** Pre-determining the acceptable probability of a Type I error.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Connecting the Plot to the Debate:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Framing Classification as a Decision:** You can frame the classification task as a decision-making process similar to hypothesis testing:\n",
        "    * **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The instance belongs to the negative class.\n",
        "    * **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The instance belongs to the positive class.\n",
        "    * **Decision Rule:** The classification threshold acts as the decision rule. If the predicted probability (or score) is above the threshold, we \"reject the null\" and classify as positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Mapping Confusion Matrix to Error Types:** Now, directly connect the components of the confusion matrix to the error types in the Neyman-Pearson framework:\n",
        "    * **False Positives (FP):** These are analogous to **Type I errors (α)**. We incorrectly classify a negative instance as positive, which means we \"rejected the true null hypothesis.\" The yellow area in the plot represents the probability or proportion of Type I errors for the chosen threshold.\n",
        "    * **False Negatives (FN):** These are analogous to **Type II errors (β)**. We incorrectly classify a positive instance as negative, which means we \"failed to reject a false null hypothesis.\" The green area in the plot represents the probability or proportion of Type II errors for the chosen threshold.\n",
        "    * **True Positives (TP):** These relate to **Power (1 - β)**. We correctly classify a positive instance as positive, meaning we correctly rejected the false null hypothesis. The red area represents the probability or proportion of correct positive classifications.\n",
        "    * **True Negatives (TN):** These represent correctly failing to reject a true null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **The Role of the Threshold (α and β Control):** Emphasize how the choice of the classification threshold directly influences the balance between False Positives (Type I errors) and False Negatives (Type II errors).\n",
        "    * **Lowering the threshold (moving it to the left):** Increases the number of positive predictions, leading to more True Positives but also more False Positives (higher α). It decreases False Negatives (lower β, higher power).\n",
        "    * **Raising the threshold (moving it to the right):** Decreases the number of positive predictions, leading to more True Negatives but also more False Negatives (higher β, lower power). It decreases False Positives (lower α).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Connecting to Fisher's Perspective (Less Direct):** You can briefly mention that Fisher's emphasis on the p-value could be seen as providing a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis for a single instance. However, the Neyman-Pearson framework, as illustrated by the control of error rates (α and β) across many decisions (or classifications), provides a more direct link to the concepts visualized in the confusion matrix and the trade-offs involved in setting a decision threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Analogy:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Think of classifying emails as spam (positive) or not spam (negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "* A **False Positive** (yellow area) is like classifying a legitimate email as spam (Type I error - rejecting a true 'not spam' hypothesis).\n",
        "* A **False Negative** (green area) is like classifying a spam email as legitimate (Type II error - failing to reject a false 'not spam' hypothesis).\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like in the Neyman-Pearson framework where we set a significance level (α) to control the rate of Type I errors, in classification, we might adjust our threshold to minimize False Positives if the cost of missing a legitimate email is high.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaway:**\n",
        "\n",
        "By drawing this analogy, you can show that the fundamental considerations of error types and decision thresholds are not unique to formal hypothesis testing but are also central to the practical task of classification. The plot provides a visual and intuitive way to understand these trade-offs in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the plot isn't a direct visualization of the p-value concept from Fisher's approach, it beautifully illustrates the core ideas of decision rules and error control that were central to the Neyman-Pearson framework and are fundamental to understanding the performance of classification models."

        "Imagine a very rare disease that affects only 1 in 10,000 people in Denton. A new test for this disease is developed that is 99% accurate. If you take this test and it comes back positive, what's the probability you actually have the disease?\n",
