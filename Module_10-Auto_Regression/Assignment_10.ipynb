        "* **Explain the Purpose of the Code:** After each code cell, clearly and concisely describe what the code is doing, *why* that step is necessary for $\\text{ARIMA}$ modeling, and how it relates to the current parameters being identified ($p$, $d$, or $q$).\n",
        "* **Justify the Decisions:** Based on the results of the plots and the $\\text{ADF}$ tests, justify the final choice for each parameter:\n",

Stationarity means that the statistical properties of the series (like mean and variance) don't change over time. This is often achieved by differencing the data (taking the difference between consecutive observations). The 'd' in ARIMA(p,d,q) represents the degree of differencing.\n",
